# italian-conjugator
Stanford Code In Place 2021 Final Project

This program conjugates a given Italian verb in its infinite form into the various present tense forms. 
It also loads a csv that contains a list of some commonly used irregular verbs and their present tense forms.
It is fairly simplistic right now with a lot of room for improvement. 
I hope to continually improve it as I learn more Italian and Python.

Possible future directions:
* GUI using Tkinter and Tkinter-Designer
* Translation/dictionary (IT-EN, or EN-IT)
* Sentence handling
